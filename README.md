# Automated Audio Analysis Pipeline

## Overview
This project provides a scalable pipeline for **audio data analysis** designed for large-scale survey datasets.  
It automates the **preprocessing, feature extraction, and parallelized computation** of thousands of audio files, improving efficiency, data quality, and reproducibility in research workflows.

The project was initially developed in **R** using packages such as `soundgen`, `tuneR`, and `parallel`, and is tailored for applications in **survey monitoring, evaluation, and development research**.

## Objectives
- Automate the processing of raw audio files collected during surveys.  
- Extract acoustic features (duration, pitch, intensity, formants, etc.).  
- Use **parallelization** to handle thousands of files efficiently.  
- Provide reproducible scripts for large-scale monitoring and evaluation projects.  
- Enable researchers and practitioners to transform **raw sound into actionable insights**.

## Methodology
1. **Data Input** – Load audio files from survey datasets (`.wav`).  
2. **Preprocessing** – Standardize sampling rates and clean files.  
3. **Feature Extraction** – Acoustic analysis using `soundgen` and `tuneR`.  
4. **Parallelized Processing** – Speed up computation by distributing tasks across multiple cores.  
5. **Output** – Structured datasets ready for statistical analysis or machine learning models.
